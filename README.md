If you're looking for free coding exercises to prepare for your next job interview, we've got you covered.

This section contains hundreds of coding challenges that test your knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and mathematics. It also has a number of take-home projects you can use to strengthen your skills, or add to your portfolio.

### [Algorithms](./algorithms/README.md)

These free programming exercises will teach you about some common algorithms that you will likely encounter in real life. They are a great opportunity to improve your logic and programming skills.

These algorithms are frequently used in job interviews to test a candidate's skills. We'll give you clear and concise explanations of how these different algorithms work so you can implement a solution for each one.

### [Data Structures](./data-structures/README.md)

These free programming courses are meant to help you deal with large and complex data structures that you may not yet be familiar with.

Working through the courses below, you will learn about each type of data structure, and implement algorithms to reinforce your understanding of them.

### [Take Home Projects](./take-home-projects/README.md)

Programming interviews have always been stressful. Job applicants are sometimes given a take home project to be completed outside of the interview. These types of interviews usually require a lot of work, but they're a great way for employers to see how you might perform on the job.

Build the bonus coding projects below for extra practice. Take your time, make them great, and put them on your resume or portfolio to show potential employers.


### [Rosetta Code](./rosetta-code/README.md)

Level up your creative problem solving skills with these free programming tasks from the classic Rosetta Code library.

These challenges can prove to be difficult, but they will push your algorithm logic to new heights.

### [Project Euler](./)

Complete the programming challenges below, from the massive Project Euler archives. These will harden your algorithm and mathematics knowledge.

These problems range in difficulty and, for many, the experience is inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem, it will expose you to a new concept that allows you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem. Can you finish them all?
